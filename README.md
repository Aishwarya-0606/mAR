# mAR
mean AR (Average recall) is a metric for measuring the accuracy of object detectors like Faster R-CNN, SSD, etc.IoU measures the overlap between 2 boundaries. 
We use that to measure how much our predicted boundary overlaps with the ground truth (the real object boundary).

The bounding boxes are expected with 8 coordinates with the text. Please check the text file for more.
I have used the SROIE 2019 dataset here.
